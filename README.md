## DataSet:https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/water-quality-data-41c5e
## Importance of Data Set:
We chose to analyze a dataset portraying water quality across diverse water sites spanning from 1889 to 2019. Delving into this dataset allows us to discern trends and fluctuations in water quality over the decades. This analysis carries significance in understanding the correlation between water quality and the survival of fish species. By surveying changes in water quality over time, we can under its direct influence on the habitat and ecosystem health crucial for sustaining fish populations.

## Question 1:
From the year 1990-2010, we want to discover when there are optimal living conditions for a Largemouth bass using the metrics of PH level, dissolved oxygen level, and the salinity level. For a largemouth, their optimal numbers are: 7.5-8.5 for PH level, salinity > 0.5ppt, and dissolved oxygen between 8MG/L - 12MG/L.

## Question 2:
Healthy aquatic ecosystems rely on the stability of various factors to support thriving aquatic life. We aim to explore the relationship between Dissolved Oxygen levels and Air Temperature to grasp their combined impact on water body conditions. What data can we extract from the correlation between Dissolved Oxygen and Air Temperature? Moreover, how does the trend line portray the relationship between these variables and what significance does it carry for evaluating the health of ecosystems?
